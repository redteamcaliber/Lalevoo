# Lalevoo
Text Steganography In Farsi Language

Lalevoo was a hobby project (result of a “Challenge accepted” type of conversation with one of my friends). It combines the **Kashida** and **White-Space** methods for hiding the message into the covert text. Using both this techniques at same time, allowed me to hide more message (bits) in less covert text. It still needs more tweaks and tricks to become a complete project. Some of the TODOs are:

1. Message text compression  
2. Analyzing the Kashida/Space frequency in the covert text for choosing the bit encoding  
3. Encrypting the message before hiding it in the covert text
